This project is a **Bank Account Simulation System** built using **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as **depositing money, withdrawing funds, 
checking balance, and viewing transaction history** — all through a simple console-based interface.


##  Objective
To understand and implement the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Java by simulating real-world bank operations.

##  Features
✅ Create a new account with account number, name, and initial balance  
✅ Deposit money into the account  
✅ Withdraw money (with balance validation)  
✅ Check current account balance  
✅ View complete transaction history  
✅ Menu-driven interface for easy use  


##  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:**  IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Compiler:** JDK 8 or above
